This software is currently under development.

The objective is to provide modular guidance/navigation/ and control algorithms for various autopilot boards and for various vehicle types.

The planned list of supported platforms:
    px4 (arm)
    arduino
    JSBSim based hardware in the loop

Vehicles to be supported:
    quadrotors
    ground vehicles
    airplanes
    helicopters

The communication protocol will be mavlink.

Notes:

Development of JSBSim software in the loop. This will talk with mavlink to qgroundcontrol, and uses flightgear multiplayer packets to talk to a flightgear server (for visualization).

The autopilot design will be thread safe and use mutex locks to accomplish this.
